Reproducing figures 1 and 2 in the paper
==========================================
 1. Compile the demo program (see PDF)
 2. Run:
        batchrun3
		batchrun4
 3. From MATLAB, run:
        plot_batchrun('run_3_1000_1000.data')
		plot_batchrun('run_4_1000_300.data')
		
 This will reproduce the figures from [2] (similar to [1]). 
 
 4. (optional) Use Python to run:
        python parse_batchrun.py
		
 This will generate statistics.
 
 
Running the examples from the papers
=====================================
 The file "examples from paper.cmd" will run the two examples
 which appear in the papers.
